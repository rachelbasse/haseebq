Hey gang,

Today (after a brief hiatus due to illness), I bring a new video where I explore the innumeracy bias. The central question I explore is this: are our minds naturally built to think in terms of probabilities and ratios? (They're not, it turns out.) And if not, then what, as poker players, can we do about it?
